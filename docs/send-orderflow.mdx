title: Send orderflow securely
description: How to send orderflow securely to a BuilderNet node.
---

Orderflow sent to [Flashbots Protect](https://protect.flashbots.net) and [Flashbots Bundle Relay](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint) is shared with BuilderNet. You can also send orderflow directly to a BuilderNet node (and validate its TEE proof).

## Sending orderflow to a builder node

You can send orderflow to any BuilderNet node that's publicly available or accessible to you.


:::tip[Public BuilderNet node]

Flashbots operates a public node:

- Orderflow endpoint: https://buildernet-01-euw.builder.flashbots.net:443
- TEE proof validation (aTLS): https://buildernet-01-euw.builder.flashbots.net:7936

### Supported API methods

1. [`eth_sendRawTransaction`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/json-rpc-methods/eth_sendrawtransaction/)
1. [`eth_sendBundle`](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_sendbundle)
1. [`eth_cancelBundle`](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#eth_cancelbundle)
1. [`mev_sendBundle`](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#mev_sendbundle)


### Example Golang code

See [this example Golang code](https://github.com/flashbots/go-utils/blob/main/examples/send-multioperator-orderflow/main.go) for sending a signed transaction to a builder node.
The example code supports requiring a specific TLS certificate as well as skipping certificate validation.

### Request authentication

Requests need a `X-Flashbots-Signature` header. The signature is calculated by taking the EIP-191 hash of the json body encoded as UTF-8 bytes.
Any valid [ECDSA secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) key (i.e. any Ethereum key) can be used to sign the payload. The address associated with this key will be used for [Redistribution](refunds).

For more details and examples on signing the payload, see the [documentation here](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint#authentication).

### Server TLS certificate

The server uses a TLS certificate that's generated inside the TEE instance, which you can verify with the TEE attestation mechanism. See also "[TEE proof validation](#tee-attestation)" for more details.

As an alternative to pinning the specific server certificate, you can also allow self-signed certificates (i.e. with `curl` using the `--insecure` flag).

### Example curl request

A curl request to send a signed transaction looks like this:

```bash
curl https://builder_hostname:443 \
    --cacert builder-cert.pem \  # or using --insecure
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'X-Flashbots-Signature: <public key address>:<signature>' \
    --data '{
        "jsonrpc":"2.0",
        "method":"eth_sendRawTransaction",
        "params":["0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675"],
        "id":1
    }'
```

See also [this Golang code](https://github.com/flashbots/go-utils/blob/main/examples/send-multioperator-orderflow/main.go) for an full implementation.

## TEE proof validation {#tee-attestation}

You can verify a builder node is running the correct code and configuration, and inside a specific TEE environment, using the [TEE attestation mechanism](encryption-attestations).

It works by making a HTTPS request through an attested connection. During the TLS handshake, the server proves that it's running inside a TEE with specific measurements and responds with a TLS certificate for future use. Based on the verifiable code and configuration, this provides assurances that this certificate belongs to a specific VM image with specific measurements.

You can use [this tool](https://github.com/flashbots/cvm-reverse-proxy/blob/main/cmd/attested-get/main.go) to get the certificate **with TEE attestation** (along with the attested measurements):

```bash
go run cmd/attested-get/main.go \
    --addr=https://builder_hostname:7936/cert \
    --out-measurements=measurements.json \
    --out-response=builder-cert.pem \
    --expected-measurements=https://measurements.builder.flashbots.net
```

You can request the certificate (without attestation) using `curl` like this:

```bash
curl -s --insecure https://builder_hostname:7936/cert > builder-cert.pem
```

This TLS certificate is now provably tied to the specific VM image, and any server with the corresponding private key is verified to run the correct code and configuration and inside a TEE.

You can use this certificate to securely send orderflow to this node on port 443 (see the previous section).

Example request requiring the server to own the private key:

```bash
curl --cacert builder-cert.pem https://builder_hostname:443
```
