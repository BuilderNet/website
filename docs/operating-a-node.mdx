## System requirements

- Intel TDX-capable CPU
- 16 cores
- 32 GiB RAM
- 2 TB disk storage, min 30K IOPS read/write, 1200MiB/s sequential read/write
- 1 Gbps Internet access

## Cloud hosting

Currently only Microsoft Azure is supported for hosting, since it's the only provider with an end-to-end working TEE attestations.
We are actively working with Google, OVH and other providers, and expect to expand the list of supported cloud providers soon.

### Microsoft Azure Cloud

For Azure, we recommend the [Standard_EC16es_v5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ecesv5-ecedsv5-series#ecesv5-series) instance type.

You'll need to request a quota for "Standard ECEV5 Family vCPUs" (16 vCPUs).

Notes the setup:
- Azure CLI version 2.65.0 (or later)
- Storage account: no redundancy necessary
- Disk: 
  - 2TB Premium SSD v1 (not v2!) with toggled ["Performance Plus"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-performance?tabs=azure-cli#enable-performance-plus) and read-only [host cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-performance#virtual-machine-uncached-vs-cached-limits)
  - Need to support 20k IOPS read/write, 900MiB/s sequential read/write

## Bare metal hosting

Bare metal hosting is currently not supported because of two reasons:

1. Hosting providers only run old BIOS versions
2. Attestations are not reliable

[This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OfT9R9JwRvIhtiNlDzktcj3_flhIOmQ-ZoiwqGp46rs/edit#slide=id.p18) has a lot more details about the challenges of TDX attestations
on bare-metal servers.

For bare-metal hosting, we are currently working with providers including Google, OpenMetal to resolve any remaining issues with measurements, attestations and BIOS upgrades.

## Metrics and dashboards

Builder nodes provide metrics in Prometheus format.
