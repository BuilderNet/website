title: Orderflow sharing and confidentiality
description: How orderflow is shared and kept confidential in BuilderNet.
---

BuilderNet nodes share all orderflow with each other, while keeping it fully confidential.

Leveraging TEE confidentiality and attestation mechanisms as well as end-to-end encryption, orderflow is only accessible to services running inside BuilderNet nodes.
No orderflow or other data is exposed to node operators, including logs or metrics of running services.

The [Operator API](./operator-api) is the exclusive interface between operators and the TDX services, and includes limited but useful information such as service healthchecks.

:::note

During initial BuilderNet bootstrapping Flashbots will receive logs and have access to nodes for debugging purposes. This access will be provably revoked as soon as possible.

### MEV-Boost Relays

Orderflow only leaves the TDX instance when sent in blocks to MEV-Boost relays. BuilderNet prioritizes relays that are fast, independent, and reliable (more [here](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/updated-mev-boost-relay-settings/4881)).

We are also working to get rid of centralized relays through efforts such as [tee-boost](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-boost/3741),
to end-to-end encrypt the entire MEV supply chain.
