### Users, Wallets, and Apps

Upgrade to [Flashbots Protect](https://protect.flashbots.net/) to transact securely through BuilderNet and get refunds for your transactions. See the [Protect documentation](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview) for more details.

You can also send orderflow directly to a BuilderNet node and validate the TEE proof for increased security. See the advanced [documentation](send-orderflow) for more information.

### Searchers, Solvers, and Builders

Submit to the Flashbots Bundle Relay or [register](https://www.notion.so/flashbots/1356b4a0d8768094a07be796f7615b30) to operate your own BuilderNet node. Learn more about how to optimize your bundles for refunds [here](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/refund-rule-wat-dis-how-to-and-faq/4049) and find historical data for your signer [here](https://app.hex.tech/9eb1e790-53f7-4c16-be76-4a22c1aa7d17/app/0c2d34ef-1304-481a-b3d6-b773ce9e0e19/latest).

### Developers

Contribute to [rbuilder](https://github.com/flashbots/rbuilder), the open source block builder that powers BuilderNet. Join the conversation in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/flashbots_rbuilder).

### Operators

We intend to incrementally onboard a small number of new operators to BuilderNet in the coming months, before making the network permissionless. If your team has experience in MEV or operating TEEs and would like to participate as an operator, please fill out [this form](https://www.notion.so/flashbots/1356b4a0d8768094a07be796f7615b30) to register your interest.

### Researchers

Contribute to the security and design of decentralized block building through initiatives like [zero trust execution environments](https://writings.flashbots.net/ZTEE), applications of software cryptography in MEV (eg. [MPC](https://writings.flashbots.net/backrunning-private-txs-MPC), [FHE](https://writings.flashbots.net/blind-arbitrage-fhe)), and more on our [research forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/c/research/20). Apply for grants from teams like Flashbots and the PBS Foundation to research new proposals like [TEE-Boost](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-boost/3741). We are interested in establishing robust benchmarks for decentralization that can be used to measure BuilderNet’s progress and bring transparency to the community, and welcome input on the [forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/).*

### Cloud providers

Support decentralization and open hardware by removing centralized dependencies in remote attestation services, supporting fully reproducible measurements, open sourcing your firmware to create a transparent chain of trust, and increasing the global availability of TEEs like TDX. We’re grateful to work closely with leading cloud providers towards these goals today and welcome more parties to join the effort.*
