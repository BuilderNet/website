In the bootstrapping phase, BuilderNet relies on Flashbots infrastructure for:
1. Builder node allowlist, provisioning and identity management
3. Archiving orderflow and bids in the Redistribution Archive.
2. Debugging and development (training wheels)

## BuilderHub

BuilderHub is the main service builder nodes rely on in the Flashbots Infrastructure.

It has these responsibilities:

1. Builder identity management
1. Provisioning of secrets and configuration
1. Peer discovery

The source code for BuilderHub can be found at [github.com/flashbots/builder-hub](https://github.com/flashbots/builder-hub).

:::info

The BuilderNet roadmap includes decentralization of BuilderHub responsibilities and permissionless builder nodes.

## Redistribution Archive

The Redistribution Archive is an archive of orderflow and bids used for MEV redistribution, to calculate the MEV value contributed by each individual transaction in a block.

The design goal for the Redistribution Archive is to be eventually distributed and fully confidential. This is a parallel architecture
and implementation track, with significant challenges. The dataset is fast-growing (about 30GB per day if the network would win 50% of blocks), needs consensus over the ordering, and must prevent withholding.

## Orderflow from Flashbots

Flashbots infrastructure sends orderflow from these sources:
1. [Bundle relay](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/overview)
2. [Flashbots Protect](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview)
3. [MEV-Share](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-share/introduction)
