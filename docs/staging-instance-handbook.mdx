description: Guide for working with BuilderNet staging instances.
---

This is a guide for working and experimenting with BuilderNet staging instances, which are disconnected from the production network and orderflow.

## Secure the Operator API

After initial startup of the instance, you need to secure the [Operator API](operator-api) by setting a password:

```bash
curl -k -v --data "<PASSWORD>" https://<INSTANCE_IP>:3535/api/v1/set-basic-auth
```

:::warning

Store the password in a safe place. If it is lost, the instance is not recoverable, and you will need to redeploy the instance.

:::

You can update the password at any time by running the same command with a new password and the old auth secret:

```bash
curl -k -v --user "admin:<OLD_PASSWORD>" --data "<NEW_PASSWORD>" https://<INSTANCE_IP>:3535/api/v1/set-basic-auth
```

Now ensure it works by testing the `/logs` API call:

```bash
curl -k --user "admin:<PASSWORD>" https://<INSTANCE_IP>:3535/logs
```

## Configure SSH access

Ensure the instance has SSH access enabled via Operator API action. You can do it with:

```bash
curl -k -u "admin:<PASSWORD>" https://<INSTANCE_IP>:3535/api/v1/actions/ssh_start
```

SSH port is 40192:

```bash
ssh "root@<INSTANCE_IP>" -p 40192 -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i ~/.ssh/your_ssh_key
```

## Patch non-containerized binaries

Most of the binaries on the VM are non-containerized, most notably rbuilder, orderflow-proxy, system-api, lighthouse and reth.

For example, to update the rbuilder binary follow the steps below.

Build the binary normally and then patch the LD path using [patchelf](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf) locally:

```bash
patchelf --set-interpreter /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ./rbuilder
```

To replace the binary with the locally build version copy it over to the VM using SCP:

```bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/your_ssh_key -O -P 40192 ./rbuilder root@<instance_ip>:/usr/bin/rbuilder2
```

Stop rbuilder:

```bash
/etc/init.d/rbuilder stop
```

Edit init service of rbuilder and replace the `DAEMON` path with the new binary:

```bash
sed -i -E 's/^(DAEMON=).+/\1\/usr\/bin\/rbuilder2/' /etc/init.d/rbuilder
```

Start rbuilder

```bash
/etc/init.d/rbuilder start
```

Check the logs of the service

```bash
tail -f /var/log/rbuilder.log
```

rbuilder config is at `/etc/rbuilder.config`

## Patch containerized binaries

Containerized workloads are bidding-service and HAProxy.

For example, to update the bidding-service binary build it as described above. Upload it with `scp -O <src> <dest>` . You don’t need to patch it with patchelf. But you’ll need to `chmod 755` the uploaded binary!

Stop the service

```bash
/etc/init.d/rbuilder-bidding stop
```

Edit init service for the bidding-service (`/etc/init.d/rbuilder-bidding`) adding another volume mount with the binary to `start_builder_bidding()` function:

```bash
start_builder_bidding() {
    podman run -dt --rm --restart on-failure --name $NAME \
        ...
	      -v /usr/bin/bidding-service-2-20230313:/bidding-service \
        ...
}
```

Start the service

```bash
/etc/init.d/rbuilder-bidding start
```

Check the logs

```bash
tail -f /var/log/containers/rbuilder-bidding.log
```

Subsidy config: `/etc/rbuilder-bidding/bidding-service.toml`

## HAProxy rate-limiting

Orderflow is first arriving at the HAProxy service, which is used for rate-limiting. The orderflow sent to the BuilderNet node is then forwarded to the `of-proxy` service.

HAProxy does currently not terminate TLS but rather proxies encrypted TCP stream to of-proxy service.

Rate limiting rules are global and stored in the HAProxy configuration file: `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`

Make sure to adjust the rules accordingly to avoid rate limiting.
