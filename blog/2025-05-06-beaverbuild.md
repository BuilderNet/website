Beaverbuild is retiring their centralized block builder to work full time on BuilderNet, a decentralized mempool and block building platform for Ethereum.

<!-- truncate -->

Beaverbuild has operated the largest block builder by market share on Ethereum since 2022. Starting today, Beaverbuild will onboard their users to BuilderNet and work closely with Flashbots to accelerate its roadmap as a development partner.

Together we will:

1. Make transactions cheaper and more private for everyone on Ethereum
2. Develop an HFT-grade TEE sequencing stack to scale the L1 & L2s
3. Remove the remaining centralized dependencies in PBS

Join us in creating a new MEV supply chain that anyone can verify, not trust.
